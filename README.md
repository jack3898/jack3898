# Y'ello!

My name is Jack Wright, and I work full time as a web developer. This account is my personal account, and won't show any professional projects.

I definitely need to try and spice up this about me section. I'll do that later. ðŸ˜‚

## Skills

I am predominently a web developer. Websites are my thing!

I can write a website full-stack with React or Angular, and also have experience with SQL databases.

I enjoy coding in my free time sometimes! You can see what I work on in the pinned section.
