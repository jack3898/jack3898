## Me!

I am predominantly a web developer. Websites are my thing! I do all sorts, from front-end to back-end, and everything in between. TypeScript is my speciality, but I also dabble in some Rust occasionally. ðŸ˜„

The projects you'll find here are mostly just for fun, and are usually just me messing around with something new. I'm always looking to learn new things, and I'm always looking for new projects to work on. Usually, the projects I work on are just for me, but I share them in case someone else finds them useful.

My full-time occupation is writing software for the UK healthcare sector (NHS) with Docker, React, TypeScript, GraphQL, MongoDB, and Node.js. I enjoy it a lot!
